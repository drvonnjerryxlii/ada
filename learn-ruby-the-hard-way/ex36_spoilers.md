> ### Endings ###

* You knock on the door a couple times and wait for a moment.
  A few seconds later, a voice from the other side asks you, "Who's there?"  
  ....  
  ".... who?" the voice asks.  
  ...  
  "I don't get it. Tell me another knock knock joke."  
  You trade a few knock knock jokes back and forth. The door finally opens up,
  revealing your friend, ???, holding a cup of hot tea out to you. "What took
  you so long getting here, anyway?" [he] asks, passing the cup over to you.
   * You found your friend. Play again?

* You call the police before finding the murder weapon. They question your
  presence in the house, and you make up a story about noticing the broken
  window and coming in to investigate after knocking on the door to check if
  everything was okay and having it swing open in front of you. They let you go
  with a stern warning not to interfere with crime scenes again.
   * You didn't find your friend. Play again?

* You call the police after finding the murder weapon. They find you in the
house, your prints all over the scene and murder weapon. The police arrest you.
As the evidence mounts against you, you become the prime suspect in the murder
trial. Although you are not convicted of the crime, the stigma follows you for
the rest of your life. If only you hadn't lost sight of [friend's name].
   * You found a murder weapon instead of [friend's name]. Play again?

* You break the window and escape, scraping your arm along the edges as you
  climb through. A neighbor sees you slithering out with blood on your arm and
  calls the police. They find your prints all over the scene and murder weapon
  and your blood on the window. When the case goes to trial, the evidence is
  overwhelmingly against you. You're convicted despite your claims of innocence,
  and you spend twenty years in maximum security prison. When you're released,
  you finally get in touch with [friend's name]'s family, who says [he] was
  never the same after your conviction. They refuse to allow you any contact
  with [him].
   * You went to prison for double homicide. Play again?

* You find the key to the basement. Everything looks normal at first glance,
  but you notice a strange hissing sound. You look up to see a wire strung from
  the open door over to the water heater. You walk over to find out what it's
  attached to. As you approach, you realize the hissing sound is getting louder.
  Alarmed, you walk more quickly. When you are only two steps away, you hear a
  creak on the stairs behind you and a clattering sound like something fell on
  the floor. You turn around to see the door slamming shut. On the ground, you
  see a grenade. There is a bright light and a concussive pressure, and
  everything goes dark.
   * You died. Play again?

* You slide the d20 into the hole. As it clicks into place, the cabinet starts
  to whir and hum. It begins shaking, then rocking from side to side. Concerned,
  you try to pry the d20 back out of the slot, but you can't seem to dislodge
  it. The noises grow louder, and the cabinet starts shaking so vigorously that
  you fear it will fall over. Just as it starts to tip, a sharp cracking sound
  comes from the middle. A rush of air blows in your face from the opening, and
  you realize there is a blue light coming from the crack. It shimmers out, and
  you could almost swear you can feel it embracing you. Your heart leaps as the
  ground seems to fall out from beneath you, the blue light taking over your
  vision. Falling through the blue abyss, you pass out.
   * You fell into a wormhole. Play again?

* ????
   * You told a bad knock knock joke. Play again?
