> ## capstone proposal 2: volunteer scheduling & management tool
- - -


- - -
> ### what's the problem
- - -

volunteer tracking & scheduling
- TAs
- guest lecturers
- tutors
- are there other types?

- - -
> ### what's already out there
- - -

- paper systems
- calendar apps
- email apps
- spreadsheets
- post its
- organizers
- various CMS products

- - -
> ### who's it for
- - -

1. primarily for Ada staff
2. but also for anyone who wants a better tool for managing volunteers
  - could perhaps also be used to track networking type stuff
  - doesn't seem viable for tracking employees, since no payroll or time clocking features

#### general ideas

scheduling system
- way for people to request shifts?
- some type of semi-public calendar that shows availability
  - volunteers can put in best / preferred times? (only self & admin can see)
  - volunteers can request shifts?
- admin can add holidays, days off, etc?
  - these can drip through to cohort calendars?
- different cohorts?
- auto email, hey you signed up for a shift today from x to y doing z
- integrate with gcal/ical?

admin's tracking system
- way to add notes to particular volunteers being tracked
  - integration with google forms?
  - color coding?
  - add to lists?
    - custom views: display lists x & y but not z
      - option to include x or y that overlap with z?
- guest lecture ideas
  - topic tagging?
  - more integration with google forms to get feedback
- tracking who said yes and what to
- admin can add categories for notes & tracking

specific to google forms
- linking results back to tracking #
- admin-facing verson of calendar has auto-generated feedback links?
  - easy to send out to

auto emails
- auto bcc recipients?

BEGIN SLIGHTLY MORE SECRET THOUGH CLEARLY 100% PUBLIC NOTES

like the grand cinema, for ADA


what they came in for
rating system
which were better than others

a lot of asks
good to keep track of who she's asked for what & what they've said yes to


guest lectures
- title req.
- maybe short description

scroll through & request a specific lecture


generates a url, and we all rate (w/o having to log in)
