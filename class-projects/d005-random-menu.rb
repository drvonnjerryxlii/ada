# Notes:
#
# 1. I really enjoyed the spoken element that Victoriya added to her calculator
#    project, so I decided to add a spoken word feature to this program. This
#    feature for mac users actually seems pretty useful, because you could start
#    the program and then walk over to various cabinets to check for ingredients
#    while the program is reeling off the resultant list.
#
#    *  It won't work for non mac users, and I wasn't sure how to handle that.
#
#    *  And because I felt I was writing this for future me, I probably did not
#       create the best user experience for users other than me. I think this
#       program does a pretty poor job of telling the user what it is doing or
#       what things it knows how to do.
#
# 2. Also, I think this will be a much more useful thingy after we learn how to
#    interact with outside files. The database stuff could be stored in a text
#    file, which would mean items added by the user could be remembered.
#
#    *  On a related note, if you see something like !W !T !R it's probably a
#       note for my future self for the next time I work on this (in case I
#       forget some of the work or tests I wanted to do.
#
# Enjoy!
