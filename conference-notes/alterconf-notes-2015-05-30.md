#### Getting Started in Open Source Software ####

[@yvonnezlam][yvntweet]
* [gitforknitters][gfk]
*  release engineer [@chef][chftweet]
  * works mostly on internal tooling & packaging & publishing of tools for the world.

[chftweet]: https://twitter.com/chef
[gfk]: https://github.com/gitforknitters/gitforknitters

open source is not organized.

before getting started in open source:
* think about identity/channels.
* consider a pers. project instead or in add.
* the "myth" of OSS community.

mange your attn around OSS:
* you're sort of going to be a minor celebrity.
   * people who get spammed on twitter after submitting a pull request.
   * people who have separate email addresses they check every 3mos b/c not wanting to see the comments otherwise.
   * just think about it.
   * [violet blue's the smart girl's guide to privacy.][vgbook]

 [vgbook]: http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21844164-the-smart-girl-s-guide-to-privacy

why not do open source?
* if you're trying to get a job, it's probably not the best venue.
   * do a personal project if you want something to talk about in job interviews.
      * showcase your own work!
      * even small projects work for this.
      * you can talk about design choices, what you would do differently, etc.
    * yvonne has had conversations w/ people about awesome .bash_profiles!

the myth of open source community:
* [geek social fallacies][gsf].
* community is reciprocal care. shared memory. lasting kind of soc. org.
* that might not be your experience in open source.

[gsf]: http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Five_Geek_Social_Fallacies

how to pick an open source project:
* is work available that you want to do?
* schedule & time commitments
* can you feel / be productive?
* what are the other people like?

__INTERESTING TOPIC != FUN TO WORK ON OR FUN FOR YOU TO WORK ON!__
* being interested in databases doesn't mean being interested in how DB administrated.
* interesting topics often req spec. skills & knowldg.
* look for projects/work where you can make progress!

seeking interesting open source work:
* check out issues / bug tracks
* projects that can use your skills/knowledge
* look for work that isn't being doing that you don't mind trying.
* don't do work you don't want to do!

non-code contributions:
* fixing documentation or typos is _not always easy_.
* some non-code changes are hard to get through as a new contributor.
* be careful about taking on emotional work.
* __look at history of contributions to see what they have accepted in the past!__

> some projects will be like:
> * yes, awesome!

> others will be like:
> * what? who are you?

open secret of open source:
* the community is made up of people who want to write code.

scheduling:
* AVOID OVERCOMMITTING
* follow project conventions for claiming work.
* synchronous events can still exist in open source.
   * can you make them? (office hours, chats, etc)

how does anyone find the time?
* some people work in companies that do that.
* some people work places that are friendly to open source.
* don't compare yourself to others negatively, since they might have co. support.

sometimes you get really excited about contributing, submit a PR, then 6mos later they get a response about fixing 5 things against the current master.
* check out their history!
* can you work with how they work?
   * example: handling whitespace.
   * are there people there like you?
      * do you want to be the person who sort of breaks them in?


benefits:
* giving back to others!
* people do get jobs from OSS work.
* diversifies conversations w/ people around tech.

#### Tech Money, Gentrification, and the Policing of Blackness in Capitol Hill ####


[@janeofearth][joetweet]

seattle tech hub:
* microsoft, boeing, amazon, tmobile, realnetworks, valve, nintendo, zillow.

amazon has really contributed so much to the growth of the city.

__influx of tech companies --> influx of wealth --> increased cost of living.__

we have an influx of tech companies, and the economy is thriving.
* you can't turn on the news without hearing about the increasing cost of living here.

what are the implications of that on society as a whole?

rent is too damn high.
* our rents are raising higher than any other city in the country.
   * it's raising even higher in capitol hill.
   * lower income residents are being priced & pushed out of their neighborhoods.
   * HOMELESSNESS IS SKYROCKETING.
      * 3rd largest in the country.
      * MEANWHILE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IS DECREASING.

the income inequality is really important to talk about.
* what effect do we have collectively?

gentrification is a popular subject in many ways. but what does it mean?
* average home prices or rents.
* average household income.
* change of neighborhood character.
   * can be subjective but also extremely literal (destruction of buildings, etc).
   * the cultures that live in those communities.
* displacement of lower income residents.
* clash of cultures.

changes in the central district:
* capitol hill is annexing the CD.
* [predominantly black neighborhood could be 10% black within a decade! :'(][10pct]

  [10pct]: http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/historically-black-central-district-could-be-less-than-10-black-in-a-decade/

police & business
* history as slave patrol.
* police protects interests of capital.
* [bus. leaders demand increased policing to protect profits.][bustweet]
* racial profiling & targeting of black & african people. :(

[bustweet]: https://twitter.com/leegoesplaces/status/604734479236628480

getting outside of our bubble
* think about our context.
   * where we live.
   * where we are.

if you have any questions about disability insurance, she recommends:
[http://www.nahu.org/consumer/diinsuranceguide.cfm][self]

[self]: http://www.nahu.org/consumer/diinsuranceguide.cfm

think about this:
* do I have disability insurance?
* can I get it?

modern life:
* work - sitting in front of a computer
* home - sitting in front of a computer
* play - sitting in front of a computer
* sleep - dreaming about sitting in front of a computer

constant pressure & unhealthy cycles.

you never know.

you are __ten times__ more likely to be taken out of a workplace by disability than by anything else.
* even having children!

disability insurance is like $40 a month!
* get: __own occupation disability insurance__.

there are so many hurdles are already in tech.
* a disability shouldn't have to be one of them.

you never know. it's easier to get the insurance and not need it.

* is that your real hair?
* is that a weave?
* being kissed on the elevator by people she didn't know.

then trayvon martin happened.
* her whole community was silent about it.
* she felt uncomfortable.
* why isn't anyone talking about this?

#### Breaking Down Diversity in Tech One Company at a Time ####

[@iamdonte][dptweet]

it's really easy to be life-changing in your own imagination.

substantial VP of culture
* they build apps. client svcs, build apps.
* his job is to make people happy.
  * --keep them comfortable, productive.

substantial is not perfect!
* "I can't change the experience that you did have, but I can change the experience that people later on are going to have."

__Diversity in 8 steps or less:__

how do you do something when you don't necessarily have the authority to do everything?

1. state your intention.
   * get up in front of the company and talk about it.
   * it's not necessarily about making people do exactly what it is you want them to do as much as it is about bringing them on board --however you need to do that.
      * some of it is making friends, influencing people.
      * it's not evil, but it is some suble psychology.

2. build a coalition.
   * you can't do all of this yourself.
   * you still have your actual job you have to do.
   * each department has different goals.
      * use that to your advantage.
      * it's not necessarily about altruism winning out.

3. listen.
   * once you have the group of people you're talking to together, ask them what they want for this.
   * show some empathy! what you may hold the most dear might not be what the group is going to hold most dear.

4. discomfort doesn't necessarily mean stop.
   * it's gonna get a little weird sometimes.
   * it can be a little different trying to explain to well to do straight wht men why divser is important.
   * just because it's uncomfortable doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.

5. start small.
   * rome wasn't built in a day, and diversity isn't going to get solved in a day either.

6. think holistically.
   * it's not just about getting people in the door. you have to keep them!

7. make everyone winners.
   * the same way you had to understand everyones motivs, make sure they're getting what they want as much as possible. keep track of what they want & the progress that's being made. help them win!

8. be realistic.
   * you're in this for the long haul, so think about it that way.

#### re: managing while black ####
[@kstewart][kstweet]


questions police ask:
* do you know why I pulled you over?
* where are you going?
* is this your vehicle?
* does this belong to you?

instinctive answers:
* no, officer, I have no idea why you pulled me over. I wasn't speeding. my tail light is not broken. I didn't cross the median.

why are you here?
* this is the way to my house. I live here.

is this your vehicle?
* yes, it's my vehicle. you're going to find that out when you check out the license & registration. I didn't real I had to carry the receipt of purchase.

__context is everything.__

in a work setting:

_"you are so articulate,"_ says the well-meaning individual.

except.. he's a manager.
* managers must have great spoken & written communication skills.
* why are you pointing out that he's articulate?
   * that's one of the job requirements.
* were you going to do business with some company where they don't have articulate people?

_"I don't see you in that role,"_ they say.

why?
* you get subjective and not actionable reasons from them.
* "you need to work on your personal brand." --> you have a perception problem. you are not meeting people expectactions around what they want from a colleague, etc. it's probably some aspect of your personality.

people of color tend to receive these kinds of feedback more than caucasians.

[greed trumps race: how to be a successful afraican american in silicon valley.][gtr]
[gtr]: http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/04/greed-trumps-race-how-to-be-a-successful-african-american-in-silicon-valley

* at the end of the day, no matter what company you work for, their goal is to make money.
* if you can find a way to showcase the fact that your ideas / approaches are going to bring money in for the company & improve their bottom line...

__the pipeline problem:__
* there aren't enough qualified people of color that we can attract.

if you're recruiting from stanford, mit, carnegie mellon, uc berkeley:
* those places aren't diverse.
* your competition is going there, too.
* __that's not a pipeline problem. that's a networking problem.__

how can we take advantage of the people of color already in our organizations & tap into _their_ networks?

hiring is broken.
* how do we fix it?
* what can we do to change our existing hiring processes?

~~...started listening too well again. >_<~~

strategies for dealing with vague feedback:
* ask for more detail.
* it's a high pressure situation & you get defensive.
   * stop. breathe.
   * well, can you tell me what it is that you don't see?
   * what are the gaps?
   * what can I do to start filling in those gaps?
* come back to it later.
   * here's what I heard from you & how I understand the situation.
   * try to tease out more info.

racism is a really strong word rooted in hate.
* you can tell when someone really doesn't like you.
   * that's racism.

underrepresentation is more dealing with unfamiliarity.
* hey, I don't know what it's like to be black.

listening as opposed to telling people.
