> ### hiring philosophy & how get job ###
- - -

## A: two key attrs ##
recruiting is everyone's job. it's exec level down.
the recruiting lens is a great view of how the company works. how was the experience? did they follow up? communication?
1. referrals!
   * referral program: incentivize reaching out to your network for new hires. "work the referral network."
2. candidate experience is key.

!Q percentage of employees from referrals?
A: 35-50% are from referrals. they try to go through every applicant, but the referral network is the best way to get in.

## J: ##
* smart ppl good comm
* cust cvs
* great time bld software & taking care of clients
* eng co., so almost everyone is a software dev -- you basically must be to get in door.
* three interviews: technical, culture fit, etc.
* don't hire or fire a lot. instead, take time to assess how well you fit culturally, technically.

### MOD COMMENT ###
* candidates hired for skills but fired for personality.

## B: ##
* wanna help great cos make great softw
* hiring process is mutual. find that mutual fit!

1. ppl really passionate about prob & space
2. great technical ppl that are a good cultural fit

1. employee referral
2. community referral
   * get involved in one of theirOSS project.

## C: ##
1. track record of success
   * things in your career
   * or great github repos!
      * demonstrates confidence & passion in one fell swoop!

2. some familiarity w/ direction tech is going.
   * so much going on in dev ops. if you're able to talk intelligently about that, about something in javascript, whatevs... if you can talk that intelligently, that does a long way.

3. cs degree?
   * a lot of best hires have not had them.
   * they've had passion for technology & willingness to take on hard problems.
      * doesn't matter what degree, he says.

## VP: ##
0. hire for co. not project!!
1. passionate problem solvers
2. can be part of team.
3. talent, not skills?
   * attitude to go and solve and learn.
   * openness to learn new things.

  * #2 gets shit done.
     * doers, makers, builders, devs that fit that.
* they want people who are a culture fit and who ask questions in return.
