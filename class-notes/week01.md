### day one ###

the morning was mostly get-to-know you games. in the afternoon, we started
digging into some basics of the program, like the student handbook.

we went over these things:
* [student handbook][sh]
* [how to os x][osx]

[sh]: https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/daily-curriculum/blob/master/Student%20Handbook.pdf
[osx]: https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/daily-curriculum/blob/master/topic_resources/how-to-os-x.md

also discussed:
* [this awesome programming tree][tree]
   * by the end of this class, we should have two or three branches lit up, so
     to speak.
* [syntactic sugar][ss] & ruby not having a lot of it
   * syntax isn't the hard part. abstractions and how you solve it are the real
     process you're learning.
   * without too much syntactic sugar, you can then focus more on the
     abstractions and what's really going on under the hood.
* off topic
   * new homestarrunner video: fish eye lens.

assigned homework:
* read preface & chapter 1 of learn to program (second edition)


### day two ###

the first half of the morning was a discussion about prominent women in
programming and computer science.

then we went over:
* [intro to UNIX][unix]
   * cmd + k - clears buffer in terminal
   * open [filename] - opens filename w/ default program
      * open -a [prog name / path] [filename]
   * ctrl + l - clears all (same as typing clear)
   * pwd - print working directory
   * ~ - home directory
   * .. - next one up
      * ../.. - two up!
   * . - current directory
   * ls -lh
   * ls -l
   * ls -lah
   * piping
      * ps
      * ps aux
      * ps aux | grep rubyls
      * history | grep irb
         * ctrl + r

assigned homework:
* look up bash profile / setting aliases
   * prompt setup: customize ps1
* read chapter 2 - 4 of learn to program (second edition)
