### day one ###

the morning was mostly get-to-know you games. in the afternoon, we started
digging into some basics of the program, like the student handbook.

we went over these things:
* [student handbook][sh]
* [how to os x][osx]

[sh]: https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/daily-curriculum/blob/master/Student%20Handbook.pdf
[osx]: https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/daily-curriculum/blob/master/topic_resources/how-to-os-x.md

also discussed:
* [this awesome programming tree][tree]
   * by the end of this class, we should have two or three branches lit up, so
     to speak.
* [syntactic sugar][ss] & ruby not having a lot of it
   * syntax isn't the hard part. abstractions and how you solve it are the real
     process you're learning.
   * without too much syntactic sugar, you can then focus more on the
     abstractions and what's really going on under the hood.
* off topic
   * new homestarrunner video: fish eye lens.
